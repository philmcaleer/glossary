## matrix

<dfn>A [container](c.html#container) data type consisting of numbers arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns</dfn>

You can use the `matrix()` function to set up a [vector](v.htm#vector) of numbers as a matrix with a specified number of rows of columns.

```{r}
# a 4x4 matrix
matrix(data = 1:16, nrow = 4)
```

Set `byrow = TRUE` to assign the vector across rows rather than down columns.

```{r}
matrix(data = 1:16, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```
