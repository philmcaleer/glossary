## fixed effect

<dfn>An effect assumed to be identical over all sampling units.</dfn>

In the standard regression model

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + e_i$$

the parameters $\beta_0$ (the intercept) and $\beta_1$ (the slope) are assumed to be constant across all sampling units (e.g. subjects). These are contrasted with [random effects](r.html#random effect), which are effects that differ across the units.

In a mixed effects model, you can get a table of just the fixed effects with the code below:

```{r}
model <- afex::lmer(
  rating ~ rater_age * face_age + # fixed effects
  (1 | rater_id) + (1 | face_id), # random effects
  data = faux::fr4
)

broom.mixed::tidy(model, effects = "fixed")
```
