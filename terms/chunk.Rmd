## chunk

<dfn>A section of code in an [R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown) file</dfn>

In an `Rmd` file, you can include a chunk by surrounding the code as in the example below:

```{r chunk-example, eval = FALSE, verbatim="r chunk-name"}
mean_age <- mean(ages) %>% round(2)
```

Also sometimes called a [block](b.html#block).
