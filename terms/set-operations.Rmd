## set operations

<dfn>Functions that compare two tables and return rows that match (intersect), are in either table (union), or are in one table but not the other (setdiff).</dfn>

The examples below use two small datasets. `a` has `id`s 1 to 5, and `b` has `id`s 3 to 7.

```{r set-operations-data}
a <- tibble(id = 1:5)
b <- tibble(id = 3:7)
```

`intersect()` returns all rows in two tables that match exactly. The columns don't have to be in the same order.

```{r intersect}
dplyr::intersect(a, b)
```

`union()` returns all the rows from both tables, removing duplicate rows.

```{r union}
dplyr::union(a, b)
```

`setdiff` returns rows that are in the first table, but not in the second table.

```{r setdiff}
dplyr::setdiff(a, b)
```

<div class="warning">
If you've forgotten to load dplyr or the tidyverse, [base R](b#base-r) also has these functions. You will either get an error message or unexpected output if you try to use them with data tables.
