## YAML

<dfn>A structured format for information</dfn>

You'll most commonly encounter YAML in the header of an [R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown) document. It consists of key and value pairs separated by a colon, where the key is an unquoted label, like `title`, and the value is quoted or unquoted text like `"My Document"` or a further list of keys and values.

```
---
title: "My Document"
subtitle: "It's Just a Demo"
author: "Me"
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')`"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
    highlight: tango
    toc: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: false
    toc_depth: 3
    number_sections: false
---
```

The spacing and line breaks need to be exactly right or YAML won't parse and you will get error messages when you try to knit the R Markdown document. For example, the header above won't knit if you change the spacing before `theme: spacelab` like this:

```
output: 
  html_document:
  theme: spacelab
```
