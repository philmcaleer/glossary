## between subjects

<dfn>Not varying within unit of observation, such that each has only one value</dfn>

For example, imagine an experiment where you test half of subjects in a dark room and the other half in a light. This experiment has one [factor](f.html#factor-experimental), room darkness, which is **between subjects** because each subject only experiences one [level](l.html#level) of room darkness, not both. This experiment may also be described as "between subjects".

Contrast with [within subjects](w.html#within-subjects).
