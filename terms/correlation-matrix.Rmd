## correlation matrix

<dfn>[Parameters](p.html#parameter) showing how a set of [vectors](v.html#vector) are [correlated](c.html#correlation).</dfn>

This is set up as a [matrix](m.html#matrix) with 1.0 along the diagonal, meaning that every variable is perfectly correlated with itself.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```


```{r}
data <- tibble(
  A = rnorm(100),
  B = rnorm(100), # uncorrelated with A
  C = rnorm(100) + A, # positively correlated with A
  D = rnorm(100) - A # negatively correlated with A
)

cor(data) # correlation matrix
