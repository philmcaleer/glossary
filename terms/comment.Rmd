## comment

<dfn>You can annotate `.R` files or [chunks](#chunk) in `.Rmd` files with comments by prefacing each line of the coment with one or more hash symbols (`#`).</dfn>

```{r comment-demo}
# I'm demonstrating comments in this chunk
# This comment will be added to the document outline ----
```


Comments get added to the document outline if you put four or more dashes, equal signs, or hashes at the end. This is a great way to keep track of more complicated scripts.
