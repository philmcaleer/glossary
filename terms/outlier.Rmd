## outlier

<dfn>A data point that is extremely distant from most of the other data points</dfn>

Outliers can be clear errors (e.g., a value of 1.56 cm for human height), fully random extreme values (e.g., 0.27% of values from a normal distribution are *expected* to be more than 3 SD from the mean), or reflect potential moderators (e.g., reaction times when paying attention versus being distracted).

The unthinking "rule" to label all data points more than 3 SD from the mean as outliers is not considered to be a good way to deal with outliers. The paper below contains useful suggestions.
