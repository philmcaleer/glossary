## standard deviation

<dfn>A [descriptive](d.html#descriptive) statistic that measures how spread out data are relative to the mean.</dfn>

If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher standard deviation. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of the [variance](v.html#variance). 

```{r sd-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Normal distributions with means of 0 and SDs of 1 (red), 2 (blue) and 3 (purple)."}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-10, 10)), aes(x)) +
