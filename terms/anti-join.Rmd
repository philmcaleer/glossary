## anti_join

<dfn>A [filtering join](f.html#filtering-joins) that returns all rows from the left table where there are *not* matching values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table.</dfn>

```{r ani-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Anti Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/anti_join.png")
```

This is useful when you have a table of data that contains IDs you want to exclude from your main dataset.

```{r anti-join-example}
all_data <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  x = LETTERS[1:5]
)

to_exclude <- tibble(
  id = 2:4
)

data <- anti_join(all_data, to_exclude, by = "id")
```

`r kable(data)`
