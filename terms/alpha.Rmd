## alpha

<dfn>([stats](a.html#alpha-stats)) The cutoff value for making a decision to reject the null hypothesis; ([graphics](a.html#alpha-graphics)) A value between 0 and 1 used to control the levels of transparency in a plot</dfn>

Can also be a parameter in the [beta distribution](b.html#beta-distribution) or refer to [Cronbach's alpha](c.html#cronbachs-alpha).

## alpha (stats) {#alpha-stats}

If you are using null hypothesis significance testing ([NHST](n.html#NHST)), then you need to decide on a cutoff value called **alpha** for making a decision to reject the null hypothesis. We call p-values below the alpha cutoff [significant](s.html#significant). 

In psychology, alpha is traditionally set at $\alpha$ = .05, but there are good arguments for [setting a different criterion in some circumstances](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/05/justifying-your-alpha-by-minimizing-or.html){target="_blank"}. 

## alpha (graphics) {#alpha-graphics}

<dfn>A value between 0 and 1 used to control the levels of transparency in a plot</dfn>

```{r alpha-plot, fig.cap="Setting alpha to a number lower than 1 lets you see parts of the plot hidden behind an object.", warning=FALSE}
# if you omit alpha, it defaults to 1
alpha1.00 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = depth, fill = cut)) +
  geom_density() + xlim(55, 70)

alpha0.25 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = depth, fill = cut)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) + xlim(55, 70)

cowplot::plot_grid(alpha1.00, alpha0.25, nrow = 2,
                   labels = c("alpha = 1.0", "alpha = 0.25"))
```
