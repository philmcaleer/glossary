## CSS

<dfn>Cascading Style Sheet: A system for controlling the visual presentation of [HTML](h.html#html) in web pages.</dfn>

[R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown) scripts are often [knit](k.html#knit) to HTML. Therefore, you can also include HTML (a way to semantically tag information) and CSS in your scripts.

Here is an example of some simple CSS (in the style tag) and HTML. 
```
<style>
  h3 { color: red; }
  .ferret { width: 200px; height: 150px; }
</style>

<h3>Red Title</h3>

<img src="images/darwin.jpg" 
     title="The cutest ferret" 
     class="ferret">
```
