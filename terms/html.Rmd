## HTML

<dfn>Hyper-Text Markup Language: A system for semantically tagging structure and information on web pages.</dfn>

[R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown) scripts are often [knit](k.html#knit) to HTML. Therefore, you can also include HTML and [CSS](c.html#css) (a way to control visual style) in your scripts.

Here is an example of some simple HTML. 

```
<h1>My Title</h1>

<p>A paragraph of stuff...</p>

<ul>
  <li>List item</li>
  <li>Another list item</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/darwin.jpg" title="The cutest ferret">
```
