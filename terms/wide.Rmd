## wide

<dfn>Data where all of the observations about one subject are in the same row</dfn>

```{r wide-data, echo = FALSE, render = "asis"}
x <- tibble::tibble(id = c("A", "B"),
            Q1 = c(1,4),
            Q2 = c(2,5),
            Q3 = c(3,6))

knitr::kable(x, caption = "Wide data")
```

Contrast with [long data](l.html#long).
