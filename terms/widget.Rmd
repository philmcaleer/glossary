## widget

<dfn>A interactive web element, like a dropdown menu or a slider.</dfn> 

See a great overview of widgets at the [RStudio Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/){target="_blank"}. In shiny apps, a widget is created by its function. The first argument is the name you will use in the code for referring to that widget and its value, so make sure it's a unique, descriptive name like `plot_color` or `group1_label`. The second argument is the label, which is a string like `"Plot colour"` or `"Label for the first group"` (it can also be an empty string like `""`).
