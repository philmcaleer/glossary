## bind_rows

<dfn>A [binding join](b.html#binding-joins) that joins one table to another by adding their rows together</dfn>

`bind_rows` takes two tables, finds all columns with the same name, and appends the second one to the first. If a column doesn't have a match in the other table, that columns' values are set to [NA](n.html#na).

```{r bind-rows}
a <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  x = LETTERS[1:3],
  y = c(T, T, F)
)

b <- tibble(
  x = LETTERS[4:6],
  id = 4:6
)

data <- dplyr::bind_rows(a, b)
```

`r kable(data)`

See [joins](j.html#joins) for other types of joins and further resources.
