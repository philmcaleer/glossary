## discrete

<dfn>Data that can only take certain values, such as integers.</dfn>

Discrete data are not [continuous](c.html#continuous), so it doesn't make sense to have a value that is partway between two values. For example, the number of texts you send per day is discrete; you can't send 12.5 texts. Discrete data can be [ordinal](o.html#ordinal) or [nominal](n.html#nominal).
