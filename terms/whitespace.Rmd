## whitespace

<dfn>Spaces, tabs and line breaks</dfn>

R mostly ignores whitespace, so you can use it to help you organise your code.

```{r}
# a and b are identical
a <- list(ctl = "Control Condition", exp1 = "Experimental Condition 1", exp2 = "Experimental Condition 2")

# but b is much easier to read
b <- list(ctl  = "Control Condition", 
          exp1 = "Experimental Condition 1", 
          exp2 = "Experimental Condition 2")
```

You may also encounter the term in the context of formatting statistics. For example, the APA recommends using whitespace around equal signs.

* with whitespace: t(49) = 1.50, p = .140, d = 0.20
* without whitespace: t(49)=1.50, p=.140, d=0.20
