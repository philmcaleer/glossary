## variance

<dfn>A [descriptive](d.html#descriptive) statistic for how much an average data point varies from the mean.</dfn>

```{r var}
data <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
var(data)
```

Variance is equal to [standard deviation](s.html#standard-deviation) squared. 

```{r var-sd}
sd(data)^2
```

You calculate variance by summing the squared differences between each data point and their mean (`sum(diff^2)`) and dividing this by the number of data points minus 1 (`(n-1)`)

```{r var-calc}
m <- mean(data)   # calculate the mean
diff <- data - m  # difference between each data point and the mean
n <- length(data) # number of data points
sum(diff^2)/(n-1) # variance
```
