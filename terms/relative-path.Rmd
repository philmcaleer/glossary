## relative path

<dfn>The location of a file in relation to the working directory.</dfn> 

For example, if your [working directory](w.html#working-directory) is `/Users/me/study/` and you want to refer to a file at `/Users/me/study/data/faces.csv`, the relative path is `data/faces.csv`. Use `../` to move up one directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# the working directory: /Users/me/study/

# read a file inside the wd: /Users/me/study/data/faces.csv
qdat <- readr::read_csv("data/faces.csv")

# read a file outside the wd: /Users/me/other_study/data/exp.csv
xdat <- readr::read_csv("../other_study/data/exp.csv")
```

Make sure you always use relative paths in an [R Markdown](r.html#r-markdown) document, which automatically sets the working directory to the directory that contains the .Rmd file.

Contrast with [absolute path](a.html#absolute-path).
