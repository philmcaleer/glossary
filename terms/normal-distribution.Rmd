## normal distribution

<dfn>A symmetric distribution of data where values near the centre are most probable.</dfn>

A normal distribution is characterised by its [mean](m.html#mean) and [standard deviation](s.html#standard-deviation). You can sample numbers from a simulated normal distribution with the function `rnorm()`. 

```{r}
# sample 1 million numbers from a normal distribution with 
# a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
x <- rnorm(1000000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

```{r normal-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Normal Distribution"}
ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x)) +
  labs(x = "Values from the normal distribution")
```


About 68% of the values are within 1 SD of the mean.

```{r}
# proportion between -1 and 1
mean(x > -1 & x < 1)
```

About 95% of the values are within 2 SDs of the mean. 

```{r}
# proportion between -2 and 2
mean(x > -2 & x < 2)
```
