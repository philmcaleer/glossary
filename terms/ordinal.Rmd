## ordinal

<dfn>[Discrete](d.html#discrete) variables that have an inherent order, such as number of legs</dfn>

Ordinal variables are not necessarily [continuous](c.html#continuous). That is, you can assume 3 is higher than 2 on a [likert scale](l.html#likert), but the difference between 2 and 3 isn't always the same as the difference between 1 and 2. Therefore, think carefully before averaging ordinal values, since the average of 2 and 4 is not necessarily equal to 3.
