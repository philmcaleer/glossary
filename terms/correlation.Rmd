## correlation

<dfn>The relationship two [vectors](v.html#vector) have to each other.</dfn>

If you sample two sets of numbers independently, they will have a correlation close to 0 (on average). If one number perfectly predicts the other, the correlation is 1 if one gets bigger as the other gets bigger and -1 if one gets smaller as the other gets smaller.

```{r cor, fig.cap="Different Correlations (n = 100)", echo = FALSE}
r <- c(-.99, seq(-.75, .75, .25), .99)
data <- purrr::map_df(r, 
  ~faux::rnorm_multi(n = 100, vars = 2, r = .x, varnames = c("x", "y"), empirical = TRUE)
) %>%
  mutate(r = rep(seq(-1, 1, .25), each = 100),
         y = case_when(r == -1 ~ -x,
                       r == 1 ~ x,
                       TRUE ~ y))

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, color = as.factor(r))) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~r, labeller = label_both)
```
