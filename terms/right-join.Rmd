## right_join

<dfn>A [mutating join](m.html#mutating-joins) that keeps all the data from the second (right) table and joins anything that matches from the first (left) table.</dfn>

```{r right-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Right Join"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins/right_join.png")
```


```{r right-join-example-setup}
X <- tibble(
  id = 1:5,
  x = LETTERS[1:5]
)

Y <- tibble(
  id = 2:6,
  y = LETTERS[22:26]
)
```

<table>
  <tr><th>Table X</th><th>Table Y</th></td>
  <tr>
    <td>`r kable(X)`</td>
    <td>`r kable(Y)`</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If there is no matching data in the left table for a row, the values are set to [NA](n.html#na).

```{r right-join-example-a-b}
# a is the right table
data <- right_join(a, b, by = "id")
```

`r kable(data)`

Order is important for right joins.

```{r right-join-example-b-a}
# b is the right table
data <- right_join(b, a, by = "id")
```

`r kable(data)`
