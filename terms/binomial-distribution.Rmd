## binomial distribution

<dfn>The [distribution](d.html#distribution) of data where each observation can have one of two outcomes, like success/failure, yes/no or head/tails. </dfn>

```{r binomial-dist}
# flip 10 coins 10000 times
x <- rbinom(10000, 10, prob = 0.5)
```


```{r binom-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Binomial Distribution"}
ggplot() + geom_histogram(
  aes(x), binwidth = 1,
  colour = "black", fill = "white") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10) +
  labs(x = "Number of heads in 10 coin flips")
```
