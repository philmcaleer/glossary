## reproducibility

<dfn>The extent to which the findings of a study can be repeated in some other context</dfn>

Reproducibility can be either with new samples from the same population ([replicability](r.html#replicability)) or with the same raw data but analyzed by different researchers or by the same researchers on a different occasion ([computational](c.html#computational-reproducibility) or analytical reproducibility).
