## default value

<dfn>A value that a [function](f.html#function) uses for an [argument](a.html#argument) if it is skipped.</dfn>

For example, `mean()` has a default value of `FALSE` for the argument `na.rm` (don't ignore NA values). 

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,NA)
mean(x)
```
So if you leave that argument out, it's the same as setting it to `FALSE`.

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)
```

And you have to explicitly set it if you want it to be different.

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

If an argument does not have a default value, you can't omit it. In the example below, there is no default value for `n`.

```{r, error = TRUE}
x = rnorm()
```
