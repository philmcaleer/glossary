## directory

<dfn>A collection or "folder" of files on a computer.</dfn>

In a file [path](p.html#path), each directory is separated by forward slashes, e.g., "dir1/dir2/file.Rmd".

Sometimes you need to check if a directory exists and/or make a new directory. For example, a script may save images in a directory called "images" that is in the same directory as the script (so you can use the [relative path](r.html#relative-path)). Below is code for checking whether that directory exists and making it if it doesn't.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
path <- "images"

if (!dir.exists(path)) {
  dir.create(path)
}
```
